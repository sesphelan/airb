## About

Paris is suing Airbnb for illegally listing 1,010 apartments on their site, the fine could be as high as €12.6 million (€12,500 per listing), if they succeed with the lawsuit. Much like New York City, Paris has very strict laws on how tenants can handle short-term rentals, however, shouldn't the tenants be fined instead?  

Currently 13 cities around the world are attempting to tighten their laws around short-term rentals by imposing fines on Airbnb. Why should the platform suffer for the actions of the hosts? In more tangible situations we see the opposite happening, for example, if someone steals a laptop from a coffee shop the person faces the consequences and not the establishment. What makes software different? Airbnb is a useful tool that lowers the cost of traveling experiences and to punish it for the hosts' actions will not halt illegal listings, as clients could easily migrate to different platforms.
